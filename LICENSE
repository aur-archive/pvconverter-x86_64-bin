affiliates (or for which QUALCOMM or any of its affiliates has received license rights) to become subject to any 
encumbrance or terms and conditions of any Open License Terms. Additionally, no act by QUALCOMM or any of its 
affiliates that is undertaken relating to the QUALCOMM PureVoice Software shall be later interpreted or otherwise 
construed as being inconsistent with the intent to not cause any patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights 
owned or controlled by QUALCOMM or any of its affiliates (or for which QUALCOMM or any of its affiliates has received 
license rights) to become subject to any encumbrance or terms and conditions of any Open License Terms.
